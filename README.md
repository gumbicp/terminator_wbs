Hi, for start program first thing you have to do is :

$ chmod -v +x *.sh ./*/*.sh

When you have all sh scripts done with chmod
for first start  write in the shell:

$ ./teminator_for_wbs.sh -en  

for help in in english:
$ ./teminator_for_wbs.sh -en -h 

interface in polish - just when you forget option ./..... -en
